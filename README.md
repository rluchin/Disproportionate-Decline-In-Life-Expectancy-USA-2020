Paper and code adapted from Nuzzo, Jennifer B., and Jorge R. Ledesma. 2023. "Why Did the Best Prepared Country in the World Fare So Poorly during COVID?". Paper was written as a means to adapt replicated data from the paper in question.
Paper relies on replication package from  Nuzzo, Jennifer B., and Jorge R. Ledesma. 2023. Data important to the project is included in this repository, but "UN_pops.csv" is missing due to its size.
"UN_pops.csv" can be acquired from https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/193684/version/V1/view?path=/openicpsr/193684/fcr:versions/V1&type=project
It is recommended that you acquire this file to credit the original authors and to maintain accuracy to the original filestructure from which this paper was written.

Due to a substantial portion of the code being adapted from Nuzzo, Jennifer B., and Jorge R. Ledesma. 2023, some use of local directories is required.
Use of local directories is commented where necessary and is only required at the beginning of the included .qmd file for the purposes of replicating this project.

Statement on LLMs: The LLM GPT4, built by OpenAI, was used to generate portions of the code used in this project.
Conversations with GPT4 can be found in inputs/llm/llm.txt
Included are both links to the conversation and the raw text pasted.

SSRP submission is also included in inputs/SSRP submission. Due to limitations of the SSRP website, the author is unable to change the original anonymity setting despite what was advertised on SSRP's site.
Screenshots which act as evidence that the authors are, in fact, the submitters of the SSRP replication can be located in inputs/SSRP submission alongside a .txt file with the link to the submission itself.
